To run the code for polarity establishment in a pair of cells, open MATLAB and enter the command >> TwoCells. 

The code in its current state will generate an instance of a pair of cells that interact via Rho signaling at the cell-cell region. The specific pathway of intercellular interaction is one of four asymmetric interactions which involves elevated Rac binding rate in cell 1 and simultaneously, elevated Rho binding rate in cell 2.

To run the code for four cells in a linear arrangement, open MATLAB and enter the command >> FourCellsLine. The code in its current state will generate an instance of four cells in a linear arrangement, with alternating elevated Rac binding rates and elevated Rho binding rates at the intercellular regions.
To run the code for four cells in a square arrangement, open MATLAB and enter the command >> FourCellsSquare. The code in its current state will generate an instance of Fig.7b.
In each of these cases, by changing the “pathway” parameter to one of the options listed in the code, other communication pathways may be implemented
